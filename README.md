# Staying-Alive-Project

The Staying Alive Project was my last project at Code for All_. It was a 24 hour Hackathon with groups of 4 to 5 elements, with projects being based on songs from the 70's and the 80's. Our song was "Staying Alive" by the Bee Gees.

Our group developed a SPA using the Symptom Checker API (https://apimedic.com/).

When you acess the web App you are greeted with this menu.

You then fill in your details, that are very important for the diagnose.
